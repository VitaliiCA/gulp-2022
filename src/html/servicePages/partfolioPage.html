                    schedule. We can create a
                    turnkey landing page
                    within a day. However, it all depends on its complexity; typically, the development of a landing
                    page
                    takes from three
                    to seven days.</p>

                <p class="advantage-card__desc">The cost is significantly lower compared to other websites, primarily
                    due to
                    the speed and simplicity of
                    landing page
                    development. However, it's worth noting that individual projects involving complex interactive
                    elements
                    with unique
                    design and site structure may sometimes exceed the cost of an online store.</p>

                    and

                    catalogs, online stores, and other
                    websites. This
                    is because a landing page is specifically tailored for a particular product or service, with
                    triggers
                    and calls to
                    action strategically placed to encourage users to take valuable actions such as making a purchase,
                    placing a call,
