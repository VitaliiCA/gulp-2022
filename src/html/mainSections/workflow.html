                <span class="workflow-card__main">Design Creation:</span> We develop the website design, including page
                layouts, color palette, and interface elements. We provide you with the
                designed concept for your approval, and only after your endorsement, we proceed to the development
                phase. If you have
                any suggestions for adjustments or refinements to the design, we are always ready to collaborate and
                incorporate
                necessary changes according to your vision and preferences. Your involvement in this process is a
                significant stride
                toward crafting the perfect web project.

                databases are created. We conduct testing on various devices and browsers to ensure its smooth
                operation.

                proceed to host it and configure the domain. We ensure that all
                links, images, and functionalities are working as intended. We will conduct basic optimization for
                search engines (SEO)
                to make it more discoverable to users through search engines.
