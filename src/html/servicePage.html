                    online store and a catalog, apart from the
                    pricing. The main distinction lies in the presence of optimized business processes within the store
                    and their absence in
                    the catalog. If a customer requires consultation when purchasing your product, creating a catalog
                    would be the better
                    solution. An online store, on the other hand, shifts the order formation process onto the buyer.
